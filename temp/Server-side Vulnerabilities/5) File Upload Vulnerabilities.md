## What are file upload vulnerabilities?

File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.

In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server.

## How do file upload vulnerabilities arise?

Given the fairly obvious dangers, it's rare for websites in the wild to have no restrictions whatsoever on which files users are allowed to upload. More commonly, developers implement what they believe to be robust validation that is either inherently flawed or can be easily bypassed.

For example, they may attempt to blacklist dangerous file types, but fail to account for parsing discrepancies when checking the file extensions. As with any blacklist, it's also easy to accidentally omit more obscure file types that may still be dangerous.

In other cases, the website may attempt to check the file type by verifying properties that can be easily manipulated by an attacker using tools like Burp Proxy or Repeater.

Ultimately, even robust validation measures may be applied inconsistently across the network of hosts and directories that form the website, resulting in discrepancies that can be exploited.


## Exploiting unrestricted file uploads to deploy a web shell

From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files, and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server.

#### Web shell

A web shell is a malicious script that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a remote web server simply by sending HTTP requests to the right endpoint.

If you're able to successfully upload a web shell, you effectively have full control over the server. This means you can read and write arbitrary files, exfiltrate sensitive data, even use the server to pivot attacks against both internal infrastructure and other servers outside the network. For example, the following PHP one-liner could be used to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem:

`<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>`

Once uploaded, sending a request for this malicious file will return the target file's contents in the response.

A more versatile web shell may look something like this:

`<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>`

This script enables you to pass an arbitrary system command via a query parameter as follows:

`GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1`

## Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload

APPRENTICE

LABSolved

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

[ACCESS THE LAB](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/server-side-vulnerabilities-apprentice/file-upload-apprentice/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload#)

 ####  Solution

1. While proxying traffic through Burp, log in to your account and notice the option for uploading an avatar image.
2. Upload an arbitrary image, then return to your account page. Notice that a preview of your avatar is now displayed on the page.
3. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history**. Click the filter bar to open the **Filter settings** dialog. Under **Filter by MIME type**, enable the **Images** checkbox, then apply your changes.
4. In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
5. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret file. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
6. Use the avatar upload function to upload your malicious PHP file. The message in the response confirms that this was uploaded successfully.
7. In Burp Repeater, change the path of the request to point to your PHP file:
    
    `GET /files/avatars/exploit.php HTTP/1.1`
8. Send the request. Notice that the server has executed your script and returned its output (Carlos's secret) in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

## Exploiting flawed validation of file uploads

In the wild, it's unlikely that you'll find a website that has no protection against file upload attacks like we saw in the previous lab. But just because defenses are in place, that doesn't mean that they're robust. You can sometimes still exploit flaws in these mechanisms to obtain a web shell for remote code execution.

## Flawed file type validation

When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in a `POST` request with the content type `application/x-www-form-url-encoded`. This is fine for sending simple text like your name or address. However, it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an entire image file or a PDF document. In this case, the content type `multipart/form-data` is preferred.

## Flawed file type validation - Continued

Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting such a form might result in a request that looks something like this:

`POST /images HTTP/1.1 Host: normal-website.com Content-Length: 12345 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg [...binary content of example.jpg...] ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description" This is an interesting description of my image. ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username" wiener ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--`

As you can see, the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a `Content-Disposition` header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own `Content-Type` header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.

## Flawed file type validation - Continued

One way that websites may attempt to validate file uploads is to check that this input-specific `Content-Type` header matches an expected MIME type. If the server is only expecting image files, for example, it may only allow types like `image/jpeg` and `image/png`. Problems can arise when the value of this header is implicitly trusted by the server. If no further validation is performed to check whether the contents of the file actually match the supposed MIME type, this defense can be easily bypassed using tools like Burp Repeater.

## Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass

APPRENTICE

LABSolved

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

[ACCESS THE LAB](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/server-side-vulnerabilities-apprentice/file-upload-apprentice/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass#)

 ####  Solution

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload files with the MIME type `image/jpeg` or `image/png`.
5. In Burp, go back to the proxy history and find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request. In the part of the message body related to your file, change the specified `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.
7. Send the request. Observe that the response indicates that your file was successfully uploaded.
8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.
