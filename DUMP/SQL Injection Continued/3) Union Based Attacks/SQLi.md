## SQL injection UNION attacks
When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.

The `UNION` keyword enables you to execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query. For example:

`SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2`

This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns `a` and `b` in `table1` and columns `c` and `d` in `table2`.

For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:

- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:

- How many columns are being returned from the original query.
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.
